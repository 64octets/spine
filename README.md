# Spine

Spine is a lightweight library for building JavaScript applications. Some parts, like its controllers, are largely based on on [Backbone](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone), others are based on some of the ideas behind [Super.js](http://github.com/maccman/super.js).

More documentation is coming soon, but for now checkout the example code in the [Todos](https://github.com/maccman/spine.todos) and [Holla](http://github.com/maccman/holla) applications.
